# RESTful Web API Design with Node.js
My coding practices from the book: [RESTful Web API Design with Node.js - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/restful-web-api-design-nodejs-second-edition)

## Chapter 1: What You Did Not Know
Key principles around the HTTP and URI standards:

- Everything is a resource
- Each resource is identifiable by an unique identifier (URI)
- Use the standard HTTP methods
- Resources can have multiple representations
- Communicate in a stateless way

The REST goals are:

- Separation of the representation and the resource
- Visibility
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Performance

## Chapter 2: Getting Started with Node.js
Steps to get started:

- Initialize `package.json` file with `npm init` command
- Install Express and other modules through NPM
- Setting up a development environment

Playing around with basic Node.js:

- Handling HTTP requests
- Modularizing code
- Testing Node.js
- Working with mock objects

## Building a Typical Web API
To sum up, I will learn the following:
